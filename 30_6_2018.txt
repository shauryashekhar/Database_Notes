Clustered Tables - two tables share the same resource space.
Real Application Clusters

Database should have just one instance (structure and functions) mapped in the memory.

User Tables - tables created/ maintained/ information entered by users

Data Dictionary Tables - created by DBMS automatically - information not entered by user - maintained and created by sys and system (root user of DBMS).
ex: User_Table, v$database, dba_xyz, etc.

v$ - dynamic performance view - value changes depending on time of acccess
dba_tables - static - values od not change until we change them.

select * from tab -> shows the tables in the database

Number and integer datatypes both store number and integer.
Integer will take less memory space than numbers.

If parameter is not passed to number, it sets aside a large slot of memory.

When copying a table, primary keys are not copied, remaining constraints such as not null are copied, remaining all structure and data is copied.


If you just want to copy table structure, command is: -
	> create table wissen_nodata as select * from employees where 2=4;


Putting brackets in alter statement allows you to modify multiple columns in one statement;


When modifying size of the column, we can only modify the length to the length of maximum vale in that column.

Use SET UNUSED to set some columns as unused and to drop them altogether later.

We cannot rollback this option, as the ALTER command is a DDL command.





desc recyclebin; - metadata table

flashback table wissen to before drop; - to retrieve dropped tables;

drop table wissen1 purge; - to completely drop a table with no scope of retreival

rename ____ to _____ - to rename tables


Three types of files:-
1. Data File
2. Control File (details of commits are logged here)
3. Log files 

(EXPLICIT) Lock on Row:
-> implemented by default.
-> only one update will get executed on that row by default.
-> the other update will get executed only after commit.

(IMPLICIT) Lock Table:-
> lock table wissen in share mode; - locks table from getting written to or updated by other users, multiple users can acquire lock.

> lock table wissen in exclusive mode, only one user can acquire this lock.


Difference between share mode and exclusive mode:- share mode allows multiple users to acquire locks on the table, whereas the exclusive mode doesn't allow that, exclusive mode will allow only one user to acquire it.

Both the locks prevent the second person from writing to the table, while it has been locked by the first user. Writing implies updation/ insertion/ deletion.

Dual table is a dummy table which can be used for date operations and calculations - accessible to all users.

DBA PRIVILEGES

DO IN SYS AS SYSDBA

Create user wissen identified by wissen; - create the user with password wissen and username wissen

Grant session to wissen - allow to login

Grant create table to wissen - allow to create table

alter user wissen account lock; - to lock the user wissen;

alter user wissen quota 2M on users; - allow memory allocation to user wissen/ edit memory allocation privileges of user wissen - also gives 2 MB of memory which the user can use for data storage. Will exceed soon.

show parameter db_block; - shows the various blocks

standard block size vs non-standard block size - oracle defined vs ability to user to define it. Grant user special permission to access this block size.

PCT-FREE and PCT-Used

ROLE (Importance): Collection of privileges and subsequent granting of role to users, which can collectively grant a large number of privileges to users in one go.

Create Role - Grant privileges to role - grant role to users.

> Create role role_name;
> grant create table, create view to role_name;
> grant role_name to user_name;

> grant select on wissen to scott; -> Grant user permission to access another users tables can be granted by any user to another

After granting:
> select * from hr.wissen; - table name is of the form username.tablename

For granting all privileges (that is equivalent to table owner): > grant all on table_name to user_name;

> Grant update(col_name1, col_name2) on table_name to user_name: grant permissions to update only those columns to username.

> Grant select on table_name to public: grant everyone the permissions on the table;

> With Grant option : allows the user being given privileges to pass them on to other users;
ex: grant select on wissen to wissen with grant option;

Propogration of privileges by use of with grant option: grant select on hr.wissen to scott;

CONSTRAINTS

> select constraint_name from user_constraints where table_name='WISSEN'; - to see all the contraints been imposed.

Add constraints - >
> alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (Column_Name);
Two or more column names within Primary Key mean a composite key.

> alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name NOT NULL (Column_Name);

> alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name Foreign Key (Column_Name) References Table_Name2 (Column_Name2);

> alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name CHECK (condition);
